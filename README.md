### Brief project description

The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has engaged Spark Consulting
to review the methodologies it uses to forecast short term electricity demand in
the National Electricity Market (NEM) and compare model performance. Spark Consulting will test whether other approaches gaining traction in
recent literature could achieve better results than AEMOâ€™s current model. These
approaches are: a statistical SARIMA model and a Neural Network Architecture,
Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT).
